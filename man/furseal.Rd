This is a subset of a data sets from Kernaléguen et al. (2015).

\details{
Briefly, fur seals the Antarctic fur seal Arctocephalus gazella and subantarctic fur seal A. tropicalis whisker SI values yield unique long-term information
on individual behaviour which integrates the spatial, trophic and temporal dimensions of the ecological niche. The foraging strategies of this two species of sympatric 
fur seals were examined in the winter 2001/2002 at Crozet, Amsterdam and Kerguelen Islands (Southern Ocean) using the stable isotope values of serially sampled whiskers. 
The subset of the initial data set is composed of consecutive whisker sections (3 mm-long) starting from the proximal (facial) end, with the most recently synthesized tissue remaining 
under the skin. Only individuals (n = 47) with whiskers totalizing at least 30 sections were selected in the initail data, and only those 30 sections were selected.
