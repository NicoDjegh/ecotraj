#' Glomel vegetation dataset
#'
#' Vegetation data set to illustrate Ecological Quality Assessment (EQA) 
#' 
#' The nature reserve of Landes et Marais de Glomel (Brittany, France) is
#' composed of temperate Atlantic wet heaths whose reference state is commonly
#' considered dominated by plant communities associated to acid, nutrient poor soils
#' that are at least seasonally water logged and dominated by \emph{Erica tetralix} and 
#' \emph{E. ciliaris}. This habitat is considered of community interest as part of the European
#' directive on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora (97/62/CEE). 
#' For the definition of the reference envelope, surveys integrated the variability
#' of reference states from youngest to early senescent stages, based on expert
#' assessment with respect to the European Directive (97/62/CEE) requirements.
#' 
#' The data set consists of 23 rows and 46 columns. 
#' The first five stations (rows) were used to define the reference
#' envelope, and the next 18 stations (rows) where those for which the conservation status 
#' was to be assessed.
