#' Relative Trajectory Movement Assessment (RTMA)
#'
#' Relative Trajectory Movement Assessment (RTMA) is a method for testing and qualifying of the relative movements of ecological trajectories (e.g. "convergence", "parallel" etc., see details) as described in Djeghri et al. (in prep). It is implemented in function \code{trajectoryRMA()}.
#' 
#' @param x An object of class \code{\link{trajectories}}.
#' @param alpha The alpha level for the tests performed in RTMA. Defaults to \code{0.05}.
#' @param nperm Passed to function \code{\link{trajectoryCorrespondence}}. The number of permutations to be used in the dynamic correspondence test. Defaults to \code{999}.
#' @param full.output Flag to indicate that the full output of tests should be computed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}. Setting to \code{FALSE} will improve computation speed but yield incomplete outputs (see details).
#' @param verbose Passed to function \code{\link{trajectoryCorrespondence}}. Should the function indicate its progress? Useful to estimate computing time if many comparisons are performed. Defaults to \code{FALSE}. Ignored if \code{full.output = FALSE}.
#' @param add Passed to function \code{\link{trajectoryConvergence}}. Flag to indicate that constant values should be added (local transformation) to correct triplets of distance values that do not fulfill the triangle inequality.
#' 
#' @details
#' Function \code{trajectoryRMA} attributes a dynamic relationship to pairs of ecological trajectories A and B describing their relative movement. It does so by combining four tests:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item{Three convergence tests performed through internal callings of function \code{\link{trajectoryConvergence}}:
#'        \itemize{
#'             \item{The symmetric convergence test between trajectories A and B.}
#'             \item{The asymmetric convergence test assessing if trajectory A approaches trajectory B.}
#'             \item{The asymmetric convergence test assessing if trajectory B approaches trajectory A.}
#'        }
#'     }
#'     \item{One dynamic correspondence test performed through internal callings to function \code{\link{trajectoryCorrespondence}}.}
#'  } 
#' To account for multiple testing, \code{trajectoryRMA} performs internally a \enc{Šidák}{Sidak} (1967) correction on the alpha level provided in parameter \code{alpha}.
#' 
#' The results of the four tests (p-values and sign of statistic) are used to assign to each trajectory pair a relationship describing their relative movements. RTMA recognizes a total of 12 relationships, some existing in "weak" variations. 
#' The following five dynamic relationships are \emph{symmetric}, i.e. applying to the two trajectories without distinction of roles:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item{\code{"convergence"} - The two trajectories converge. Exists in a weak version.}
#'     \item{\code{"divergence"} - The two trajectories diverge. Exists in a weak version.}
#'     \item{\code{"parallel"} - The two trajectories travel side by side with broadly similar movements.}
#'     \item{\code{"antiparallel"} - As in \code{"parallel"} but the two trajectories travel in opposite directions.}
#'     \item{\code{"neutral"} - The two trajectories have no particular movements relative to each other (effectively the null hypothesis for RTMA).}
#'  }
#' The following seven dynamic relationships are \emph{asymmetric} (e.g. in \code{"pursuit"} there is a leading and a following trajectory). In these asymmetric relationships the output of function \code{trajectoryRMA} gives the role of each trajectory (see Value section).
#' \itemize{
#'     \item{\code{"approaching"} - One trajectory approaches the other.}
#'     \item{\code{"approaching-stationary"} - As in \code{"approaching"} but the trajectory approached is stationary relative to the approaching trajectory.}
#'     \item{\code{"departing"} - One trajectory moves away from the other.}
#'     \item{\code{"departing-stationary"} - As in \code{"departing"} but the trajectory departed from is stationary relative to the departing trajectory.}
#'     \item{\code{"pursuit"} - The two trajectories follow each other.}
#'     \item{\code{"catch-up"} - As in \code{"pursuit"} but the following trajectory moves faster.}
#'     \item{\code{"escape"} - As in \code{"pursuit"} but the leading trajectory is faster.}
#' }
#' 
#' In rare cases, unlikely relationships (labelled \code{"unknown"}, with a short description in brackets) may occur. These involve contradictory patterns hard to interpret.
#' 
#' LIMITATIONS: RTMA has some limitations, in particular it uses trend tests not well suited to study trajectories pairs with changing relative movements (e.g. if two trajectories cross each other, they are first converging then diverging).
#' We advise users to not only rely on RTMA but to also visualize trajectories using function \code{\link{trajectoryPCoA}} for ecological interpretations. See Djeghri et al. (in prep) for more details.
#' Note also that, because RTMA incorporates a correction for multiple testing, it needs somewhat long trajectories to operate (minimum number of survey = 6 at alpha = 0.05).
#' 
#' COMPUTATION TIME: The dynamic correspondence tests performed in RTMA are computationally costly permutation tests only used when all three convergence tests are non-significant.
#' Function \code{trajectoryRMA} performs by default all tests but it is possible to only perform the tests useful for RTMA by setting \code{full.output = FALSE}.
#' This will reduce computation time but the details of the output of RTMA will not contain the information on all possible dynamic correspondence tests, only on relevant ones.
#' 
#' PLOTTING: Function \code{\link{trajectoryConvergencePlot}} provides options to plot the results of RTMA.
#' @returns
#' Function \code{trajectoryRMA} returns an object of class \code{\link{list}} containing:
#' \itemize{
#'     \item{\code{dynamic_relationships_taxonomy}: a data-frame containing the names of the relative movement relationships recognized by RTMA as well as higher order groupings. This part of \code{trajectoryRMA} output is independent of the trajectories used as input and only serve as an interpretation guide (see Djeghri et al. in prep).}
#'     \item{\code{dynamic_relationships}: a matrix containing the relative movement relationships attributed to each pair of trajectories.}
#'     \item{\code{symmetric_convergence}: a list containing the results of the symmetric convergence test.}
#'     \item{\code{asymmetric_convergence}: a list containing the results of the two asymmetric convergence tests.}
#'     \item{\code{correspondence}: a matrix containing the results of the the dynamic correspondence tests (partial if \code{full.out = FALSE}).}
#'     \item{\code{parameters}: a vector containing the parameters \code{alpha}, the \enc{Šidák}{Sidak} \code{corrected_alpha}, and \code{nperm}}.
#'  }
#' In addition to the relationships recognized by RTMA, matrix \code{dynamic_relationships} provides the role of each trajectory in asymmetric relationships. 
#' The role is provided in parenthesis and applies to the trajectory of the ROW index. For example, \code{"approaching (approacher)"} means 
#' that the trajectory of the corresponding row is approaching the trajectory of the corresponding column, which will have \code{"approaching (target)"}.
#' In symmetric relationships, the wording \code{(symmetric)} is added to indicate that there is no distinction of roles.
