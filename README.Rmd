## Introduction

Package `ecotraj` is a package providing Ecological Trajectory Analysis (ETA), a framework to assist ecologists in the analysis of temporal changes in ecosystems defined on a chosen multivariate space. 

ETA is related to the following publications:

* Presentation of the community trajectory analysis framework (De Cáceres et al. 2019).

* Extension of community trajectory analysis (Sturbois et al. 2021a). 

* Presentation of the cyclical ecological trajectory analysis framework (Djeghri et al. in prep.).

* Generalization to stable isotope data (Sturbois et al. 2021b).

* Application of ETA framework for the assessment of ecological quality (Sturbois et al. 2023).

## Package installation and documentation

Package `ecotraj` can be found at [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ecotraj). In addition, the latest stable `ecotraj` R package can also be installed from GitHub as follows:

```{r installation, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("emf-creaf/ecotraj")
```

Although the package comes with function documentation, articles explaining how to use the package can be found at https://emf-creaf.github.io/ecotraj/.

## Package functions

The following lists the main package functions, grouped by analysis framework:

#### Ecological Trajectory Analysis (ETA)

| Name | Short description      |
|------|------------------------|
| `extractTrajectories()` | Extracts (sub-)trajectories corresponding to selected set of sites from a dataset containing multiple trajectories.  |
| `smoothTrajectories()` | Performs multivariate smoothing on trajectory data using a Gaussian kernel. |
| `centerTrajectories()` | Shifts all trajectories to the center of the multivariate space and returns a modified distance matrix.  |
| `trajectoryLengths()` | Calculates lengths of directed segments and total path lengths of trajectories.       |
| `trajectoryLengths2D()` | Calculates lengths of directed segments and total path lengths of trajectories from 2D coordinates given as input. |
| `trajectoryAngles()` |  Calculates the angle between consecutive pairs of directed segments or between segments of ordered triplets of points.     |
| `trajectoryAngles2D()` |   Calculates the angle between consecutive pairs of directed segments or between segments of ordered triplets of points from 2D coordinates.     |
| `trajectoryConvergence()` |  Performs the Mann-Kendall trend test on the distances between trajectories or the distance between points of one trajectory to the other. |
| `trajectoryDirectionality()` | Assesses the level directionality of each trajectory. |
| `trajectoryVariability()` |    Assesses the internal variability within each trajectory.    |
| `trajectoryDistances()` |  Estimates distances between pairs of ecosystem trajectories.  |
| `trajectoryPlot()` | Draws trajectories in a 2D-plot corresponding to the input coordinates.       |
| `trajectoryPCoA()` | Performs principal coordinates analysis and draws trajectories in the ordination scatterplot.            |


#### Cyclical Ecological Trajectory Analysis (CETA)


| Name | Short description      |
|------|------------------------|
| `extractCycles()` | Extracts (i.e. subsets) cycles from cyclical trajectories.        |
| `extractFixedDateTrajectories()` | Extracts fixed-date trajectories from cyclical trajectories.  |

| `cycleConvexity()` |  Estimates the degree of convexity of cycles.     |
| `cyclePCoA()` | Performs Principal Coordinates Analysis and draws cycles in the ordination scatter plot.    |

#### Ecological Quality Assessment (EQA)

| Name | Short description      |
|------|------------------------|
